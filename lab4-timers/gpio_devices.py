"""
This module provides classes to manage common input/output components, 
such as buttons and LEDs, with support for PWM-based brightness control 
for LEDs. The classes allow for checking button states, toggling LEDs, 
blinking LEDs, and controlling brightness and fading effects using PWM.

Example
-------
.. code-block:: python

    from gpio_devices import Led, PWMLed

    led = Led(2)

    print("LED blinking...")
    led.blink(times=3)

    print("Toggling LED...")
    led.toggle()

    # Example of using the PWMLed class
    led = PWMLed(3)

    print("Fading in...")
    led.fade_in(duration=2)

Modification history
--------------------
- **2026-10-05** : Button implemented simple debouncing and other methods. RGBLed class added to control RGB LEDs. `pulse` method added to Led class. PWMLed methods substituted `duty` to `duty_u16` for Raspberry Pi Pico.
- **2025-10-15** : Button redefined so that it inherits from Pin.
- **2024-11-11** : Added Sphinx-style comments for documentation.
- **2024-10-26** : Added `demo` method to demonstrate usage of the classes.
- **2024-09-28** : File created, initial release.
